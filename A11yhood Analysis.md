In [Mia Mingus's essay "Forced Intimacy: An Ableist Norm,"](https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2017/08/06/forced-intimacy-an-ableist-norm/) Mia Mingus examines the expectation that disabled individuals must share an exessive amount of personal information and engage in emotional labor to navigate an ableist society. This concept, termed "forced intimacy," manifests in various ways, including the necessity for disabled people to disclose intimate details about their bodies and needs or build and sustain emotional intimacy and relationships with someone in order to get access. The author reflects on their experiences, stating, “I am always expected to do the work of opening myself up for others’ benefit, education, curiosity or benevolent oppression”. 

Such expectations place further undue burden on disabled individuals, leading to vulnerability and the violation of consent. The author highlights specific instances, such as when able-bodied people push her wheelchair without consent or when physical support is needed from strangers, noting the discomfort and lack of safety in these situations. She expresses that “disabled people are expected to ‘show all our cards’” to survive in an able-bodied supremacist world.

Mingus criticizes the ableist tendency to treat access as merely logistical rather than personal, emphasizing, “Able bodied people treat access as a logistical interaction, rather than a human interaction." The author also contrasts forced intimacy with “access intimacy,” which involves mutual understanding and respect in interactions regarding access needs. Ultimately, she advocates for recognizing the vulnerability inherent in access, calling for a future where disabled individuals can assert consent and agency over their bodies and experiences.

The author concludes by noting, “Though I have written here about forced intimacy as it relates to disability and access, it is in no way relegated only to ableism," highlighting the broader implications of forced intimacy across various forms of oppression.

## Positive Disability Principles Analysis (200-300 words)

Forced intimacy is inherently ableist. The practice of expecting disabled people to do all of the emotional labor to access. This expectation drains disabled people and inequally places the duty entirely on disabled rather than the collective of human society. This expectation forces disabled folk into a position where they must constantly justify their existance and needs, rather than simply receiving the support they ask for. This is why it also is not accessible, as forced intimacy generates a dynamic where disabled people must mechnically share, as a form of "logistical" issue rather than the foundation of a relationsihp. 

These issues of inaccessibility and ableism stem from the lack of interest in being disability-led. In society, able-bodied perspectives and experiences are put above the needs and wants of disabled folk. "Forced intimacy" sidelines the voices of disabled individuals in conversations about access and support, adding far too many barriers to their access and removing them from their position to change things. Thus, forced intimacy illustrates how able-bodied folk are not put at the forefront.

Examples given by Mingus also illustrate the intersectional nature of forced intimacy. She highlights how forced intimacy interacts with other identities, including race, gender, and class. Mingus-- as a transracial woman, for example--faces the emotional labor of discussing her experience as an adoptee. This intersectionality deepens the burden of forced intimacy, making it clear that the struggle for access and respect is multifaceted and requires a nuanced understanding of how various forms of oppression intersect.

## Plain Text Summary

The five guidelines I’m focusing on are using simple words, using positive language, using short paragraphs, using active voice, and using one sentence for one key point.

I am writing about [Forced Intimacy](https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2017/08/06/forced-intimacy-an-ableist-norm/). Mia Mingus is the author. "Forced Intimacy" means you have to tell people too much about your disability to get the things you need. You have to work hard with your emotions to do this, which is hard. 

One example is sharing details about your body that you want to keep to yourself to get what you want. Another example is doing a lot of work to be friends with someone so they can help you get what you want. Mingus shares that she has to do lots of work teach others, but does not want to. 

The world is made for people without disability, or "able-bodied people." Able-bodied people want disabled people to share everything they need with everyone. Disabled people should be able to say yes or no to sharing. 

But people want disabled people to be the *only* people doing the work. This makes people ignore the permission given by disabled people. Disabled people feel unsafe when their permission is ignored. Mingus feels unsafe when able-bodied people push her wheelchair without her permission. 
 
Mingus dislikes how able-bodied people view getting disabled people what they need as a chore instead of a relationship. 

“Forced intamacy" is the opposite of "access intimacy.” Access intimacy is when disabled and able-bodied people respect each other and care about each other. Migus wants the vulnerability inherent in access, calling for a future where disabled individuals can assert consent and agency over their bodies and experiences.

Forced intimacy is not only about disabilty. Mingus faces forced intimacy about her identity. highlighting the broader implications of forced intimacy across various forms of oppression.
