## Article Summary

In [Mia Mingus's essay "Forced Intimacy: An Ableist Norm,"](https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2017/08/06/forced-intimacy-an-ableist-norm/), she discusses how her personal encounters reflect the pressure on disabled individuals to divulge intimate details and provide emotional support, especially in a world dominated by ableism. The idea of "forced intimacy" involves the need for individuals with disabilities to share information about their bodies or establish emotional bonds with others to access necessary support and resources. Mingus shares her perspective by mentioning that she often feels pressured to reveal aspects of herself for the benefit or curiosity of others.

Such expectations place burden solely on disabled individuals instead of enabling society to care collectively for disabled folk. This strips them of their ability to consent and leaves them vulnerable to societal oppression. Mingus mentions incidents where people without disabilities push her wheelchair without asking, illustrating how uncomfortable and unsafe it makes her feel. She points out how "disabled people are expected to ‘show all our cards’” to survive in today's "able-bodied supremacist world." Mingus shows a societal tendency to view access as merely a logistical issue rather than one that involves personal connections and relationships. To strip accessibility of its human nature and completely mechanize it.

Mingus then compares the concept of "forced intimacy” with "access intimacy," which encourages full understanding and willingness regarding accessibility. Her ultimate aspiration is a world where disabilities are not viewed as "burdensome" or "tragic"; instead, a catalyst for change and uplifting numerous individuals.

Mingus concludes by stating that “though I have written here about forced intimacy as it relates to disability and access, it is in no way relegated only to ableism,” highlighting the broader implications of forced intimacy across and in conjunction with different identities and how it gets in the way of genuine human connection.

## Positive Disability Principles Analysis

### Ableism
Forced intimacy is inherently ableist. It expects disabled people to do all of the emotional labor to get what they need. This expectation drains disabled people and places the duty entirely on the disabled rather than the collective of human society. This expectation forces disabled folk into a position where they must constantly justify their existence and needs rather than simply receiving the support they ask for. 

### Accessible
The previous point also shows how forced intimacy is not accessible, as forced intimacy generates a dynamic where disabled people must share mechanically, as a form of "logistical" issue rather than the foundation of a relationship. This isn't a simple relational dynamic to navigate, especially if the motivation solely comes from disabled folks. 

### Disability Led
These issues of inaccessibility and ableism stem from the lack of interest in being disability-led. In society, able-bodied perspectives and experiences are put above the needs and wants of disabled folk. "Forced intimacy" sidelines the voices of disabled individuals in conversations about access and support, adding far too many barriers to their access and removing them from their position to change things. Thus, forced intimacy illustrates how able-bodied folk are put at the forefront.

### Agency

Agency is somewhat put in the hands of disabled folk through forced intimacy. The access needs that they suggest, or the needs and wants that they have are heard out and thus able to be implimented. However, this doesn't really give disabled folks *true* agency, instead relegating them to the whims of abled-bodied folks and society. Because of forced intimacy, people are actually *forced* to overshare about their life, losing control over their own narrative and select the people who get to hear about their history.  

### Intersectionality
Examples given by Mingus also illustrate the intersectional nature of forced intimacy. She highlights how forced intimacy interacts with other identities, including race, gender, and class. Mingus, as a transracial woman, for example, faces the emotional labor of discussing her experience as an adoptee. This intersectionality deepens the burden of forced intimacy, making it clear that the struggle for access and respect is multifaceted and requires a nuanced understanding of how various forms of oppression intersect.

## My Disability Justice Analysis

### Collective Access

#### Definition

**Collective access** is found in making sure that everyone, no matter the disabilities they have/identify with (or factors outside of disability, like race, gender, etc) can still be part of the disability community. This doesn't mean stripping everyone of their individual identities, but actually acting upon those and ensuring that with our differences, we can still be treated as people. This ideology clashes with our current, able-bodied society where the needs of able-bodied people are prioritized. From this, collective access seeks to look past the solutions proposed by current society, and ensure that no matter the disabiility, the unique needs of people are shared. 

#### Analysis

Forced intimacy violates the premise of collective access and undermines the ability to interact in a shared world. Specifically, it pressures individuals to conform to the norms of the current, inaccessible, able-bodied society, which often overlooks the diverse needs and experiences of marginalized groups. Mingus shares that understanding forced intimacy was “one of the many ways I learned that consent does not exist for my disabled asian girl body-mind.” The inability to feel secure in one’s autonomy and ability to consent illustrates this pigeonholding of one’s personal self to fit within the parameters of society. This not only limits their ability to express their authentic selves but also perpetuates a cycle of alienation and prevents folks from grounding in their own feelings.

The expectation of forced intimacy significantly hampers disabled individuals from pursuing collective access, as it places excessive barriers to receiving the access. Whether it is the sharing of extremely intimate details or having to do it repeatedly, disabled folks will then feel pressured to compromise their boundaries. This can lead to discomfort, burnout, or even trauma as they navigate spaces that do not consider their autonomy. As a result, the genuine desire for collective access is stifled, and disabled individuals may withdraw from community engagement altogether. Creating inclusive spaces requires rethinking our social norms to allow for authentic participation, where everyone’s boundaries are respected and collective access can thrive.

### Anti-capitalist politics

#### Definition

**Anti-capitalist politics** critiques the capitalist superstructure for perpetuating inequalities that marginalize people with disabilities. It emphasizes the need for systemic change to prioritize collective well-being over profit-driven motives. This means resisting the current expectations for productivity and understanding that one’s worth is independent of what/how much we produce.

#### Analysis

For one, forced intimacy is a result of the current capitalist means of production, and a way to squeeze out more profit from the individual. Big corporations and companies are unyielding and will try to keep as much for themselves,leaving only a few crumbs for people to fight over, including disabled folks. Rather than ensuring that folks are able to collaborate and build each other up in providing for each other's needs, there is this pressure for everyone to compete with one another to collect the small crumbs that are available. And this is found in forced intimacy, as it is a way to eek out crumbs and beg the current society as a form of penance, all in exchange for the bare minimum.

Thus, forced intimacy does not address anti-capitalist politics and instead perpetuates the superstructure of capitalism to further cause the broad oppression of disabled folks. Mingus argues that forced intimacy demands constant emotional labor from disabled people, forcing them to share personal details about their lives to secure basic needs and support. This expectation aligns with capitalist notions that individuals should constantly justify their existence through productivity and engagement, making it particularly burdensome for those who may not have the capacity or desire to engage in such labor.

Furthermore, the societal pressure to engage in forced intimacy can create a sense of obligation that stifles authentic relationships. Mingus notes that she is often expected to open herself up for the benefit of others’ curiosity or education, which is rooted in the capitalist notion that folks should labor (in this case emotionally) regardless of their capacity, ability, or desire to do so. This dynamic perpetuates systemic inequalities, as disabled people are made to feel that their worth is contingent upon their ability to share their experiences for others’ benefit. An anti-capitalist framework implores us to resist these productivity-based expectations (such as the “need” to educate). 

### Sustainability

#### Definition

**Sustainability** refers to the ability to feel security in the speed at which those around us and we as individuals are moving through society. Instead of aligning to societal pressure and urgency, we should lean into the feelings within our bodies and personal experiences to guide our societal actions to slowly but surely pursue justice.

#### Analysis

Forced intimacy is far from sustainable, especially for disabled people. Mingus clarifies that forced intimacy imparts an expectation of large, continuous amounts of emotional labor; it holds folks accountable to always be engaged in conversations so that people won't be mad. For Mingus, this means that “I am always expected to do the work of opening myself up for others’ benefit, education, curiosity or benevolent oppression.” The pressure to share personal stories and experiences for others’ benefit is not only exhausting but also damaging to her well-being. This expectation means that disabled individuals often feel compelled to engage in constant self-disclosure, opening themselves up to others' inquiries, education, or even well-meaning but intrusive curiosity. Such a requirement can lead to emotional burnout, further exacerbating the challenges disabled individuals face in navigating their lives.

Moreover, the societal expectation for individuals to consistently engage in this emotional labor can create an unsustainable cycle of overexertion and fatigue. Mingus highlights that she is expected to do the work of educating others without considering her own needs for rest and privacy. This dynamic not only impacts her mental and emotional health but also undermines the potential for meaningful relationships built on mutual understanding and respect. In essence, forced intimacy disregards individuals' need to find balance and security in their interactions, instead exposing them to the harsh realities of the world. 

## Plain Text Summary

The five guidelines I’m focusing on are using simple words, using positive language, using short paragraphs, using active voice, and using one sentence for one key point.

I am writing about [Forced Intimacy](https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2017/08/06/forced-intimacy-an-ableist-norm/). Mia Mingus is the author. "Forced Intimacy" means you have to tell people too much about your disability to get the things you need. You have to work hard with your emotions to do this, which is hard.

One example is sharing details about your body that you want to keep to yourself to get what you want. Another example is doing a lot of work to be friends with someone so they can help you get what you want. Mingus shares that she has to do lots of work to teach others but does not want to.

The world is made for people without disability or "able-bodied people." Able-bodied people want disabled people to share everything they need with everyone. Disabled people should be able to say yes or no to sharing.

But people want disabled people to be the *only* people doing the work. This makes people ignore the permission given by disabled people. Disabled people feel unsafe when their permission is ignored. Mingus feels unsafe when able-bodied people push her wheelchair without her permission.
 
Mingus dislikes how able-bodied people view getting disabled people what they need as a chore instead of a relationship. She hopes for a world where disabilities are not seen as bad. Mingus wants us to see disabilities as a way to improve the world.

Forced intimacy is not only about disability. Mingus faces forced intimacy about her identity. She highlights the way forced intimacy impacts her as a child from another country.
