## Article Summary (200-300 words)

In [Mia Mingus's essay "Forced Intimacy: An Ableist Norm,"](https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2017/08/06/forced-intimacy-an-ableist-norm/) Mia Mingus examines the expectation that disabled individuals must share an exessive amount of personal information and engage in emotional labor to navigate an ableist society. This concept, termed "forced intimacy," manifests in various ways, including the necessity for disabled people to disclose intimate details about their bodies and needs or build and sustain emotional intimacy and relationships with someone in order to get access. The author reflects on their experiences, stating, “I am always expected to do the work of opening myself up for others’ benefit, education, curiosity or benevolent oppression”. 

Such expectations place further undue burden on disabled individuals, leading to vulnerability and the violation of consent. The author highlights specific instances, such as when able-bodied people push her wheelchair without consent or when physical support is needed from strangers, noting the discomfort and lack of safety in these situations. She expresses that “disabled people are expected to ‘show all our cards’” to survive in an able-bodied supremacist world.

Mingus criticizes the ableist tendency to treat access as merely logistical rather than personal, emphasizing, “Able bodied people treat access as a logistical interaction, rather than a human interaction." The author also contrasts forced intimacy with “access intimacy,” which involves mutual understanding and respect in interactions regarding access needs. Ultimately, she advocates for recognizing the vulnerability inherent in access, calling for a future where disabled individuals can assert consent and agency over their bodies and experiences.

The author concludes by noting, “Though I have written here about forced intimacy as it relates to disability and access, it is in no way relegated only to ableism," highlighting the broader implications of forced intimacy across various forms of oppression.

I am writing about [Forced Intimacy](https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2017/08/06/forced-intimacy-an-ableist-norm/). Mia Mingus is the author. "Forced Intimacy" means you have to tell people too much about your disability to get the things you need. You have to work hard with your emotions to do this, which is hard. 

One example is sharing details about your body that you want to keep to yourself to get what you want. Another example is doing a lot of work to be friends with someone so they can help you get what you want. Mingus shares that she has to do lots of work teach others, but does not want to. 

The world is made for people without disability, or "able-bodied people." Able-bodied people want disabled people to share everything they need with everyone. Disabled people should be able to say yes or no to sharing. 

But people want disabled people to be the *only* people doing the work. This makes people ignore the permission given by disabled people. Disabled people feel unsafe when their permission is ignored. Mingus feels unsafe when able-bodied people push her wheelchair without her permission. 
 
Mingus disllikes how able-bodied people view getting disabled people what they need a logistical rather than personal, emphasizing, “Able bodied people treat access as a logistical interaction, rather than a human interaction." 

“Forced intamacy" is the opposite of "access intimacy.” Access intimacy is when disabled and able-bodied people respect each other and care about each other. Migus wants  the vulnerability inherent in access, calling for a future where disabled individuals can assert consent and agency over their bodies and experiences.

Forced intimacy is not only about disabilty. Mingus faces forced intimacy about her identity. highlighting the broader implications of forced intimacy across various forms of oppression.
