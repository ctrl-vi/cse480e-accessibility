# Accessibility Implementation Reflection

By: Violet Monserate

## Website Information

### What website/app and task were you testing?
 
I was testing a project website I made in 2022 for Changemakers in Computing. Here is an image of the unedited website:

![Screenshot of the webpage Protbot created by Violet Monserate. Broadly space-themed, with header using a purple to blue gradient, and the background image is a dark purple starfield with white speckles and white text over it. The header says "ProtBot" in light steel blue. There is a scrolling subheader that says Created by Violet Monserate, Alex Vicuna Perez, and Sophia Lam." The navbar before has the tabs "Home", "Our Prototype", "About Us", and "Our Presentation." The main message below says "Never hesitate to make a difference ever again." The next header says "What is Protbot?" in white with the "What" using light steel blue](<Images/Website Overview.png>)

Here is a [link to the ORIGINAL UNEDITED website](https://prot-bot.glitch.me/).

The main task I focused on was to "learn more about protbot," thus going through the homepage, looking at the "about us" page, and ending with nagivating through the prototype.

## Accessibility Technology

### Magnifier

#### What is it?

The magnifier is an access technology that has found its way into many piece of technology, including Windows 11 and 10 (according to this [Webpage on Microsoft's Support Page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-magnifier-to-make-things-on-the-screen-easier-to-see-414948ba-8b1c-d3bd-8615-0e5e32204198)). They follow a couple design paradigms, including the usage of a digital magnification zone in the center of the screen, with the peripherals being unzoomed. They can also use the entire screen to display zoomed content, or just the viewport within their browser. The specific application I used for magnification while testing the GSBA website-Firefox-is described in [Mozilla's support page about font size and zoom](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/font-size-and-zoom-increase-size-of-web-pages). There are built-in keyboard shortcuts that allow the user to interact with the magnifier, including symbols in the navbar at the top of the browser and keyboard (and mouse) shortcuts. There is also the usage. Overall, the way one can zoom into varied and the one that a user chooses can depend on their access needs and the situtation they are faced with. 

#### What disabilities does it support?

The magnifier supports those with Visual Impairment, such as John Klatt [in this Youtube video from the University of Wisconsin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZRVDgeMpXc). John Klatt has a form of muscular degeneration, and shows how different types of magnification work better/are less disorienting than others. Through magnification, the content can be expanded to help the user parse out more detail within the application/webpage,. For example, an image can be further zoomed into to see the details, potentially to a higher degree than the alt text (they do say that an image is worth a thousand words). 

It can also also assist those with learning/intellectual disabilities, including ADHD, dyslexia, or a visual processing disability. By using the ability to zoom in, there is less "clutter" on the screen, allowing for folks to focus on the specific image, sentence, or even word if they zoom in sufficiently; users can feel less overwhelmed by the vast contents of the page and only have one part in focus on the entire screen. 

#### What are its strengths and/or weaknesses?

There is a wide variety of magnification softwares, including the ones demonstrated in the aforementioned Youtube video. This means that it is highly customizable to the situtation as well as the wants and needs of the disabled people utilizing magnifiers. So whether someone is using it to assist with their visual impairment or to focus on specific parts of the webpage, they were able to customize the experience to their needs (as mentioned in the above section). Customization also acts as a form of empowerment, allowing disabled people to navigate and take in information at the pace or zoom level that meets their needs, rather than relying on someone else to convey the data or one very specific version of a zoom tool. 

The different modalities to interact with zoom also is intriguing. One can use digital buttons within the GUI of the zooming software, but there are keyboard shortcuts (the most common being ctrl + "+"), or even mouse shortcuts (like holding ctrl and scrolling). Furthermore, there is the use of a trackpad, which further faciltates the moving of the viewport with two-finger swiping, making the movement around zoomed content more clear and fluid.  

I also like how the firefox zoom is built into the webpage, allowing disabled folk to use the zoom on any computer, without additional software. This increases it prevalance, and really makes it ubiquitous and freely avaiability to all. 

One weakness is how context can get lost when very zoomed in. This is mentioned by John in the above Youtube video, but because of the lack of context within the peripheral, around the area that is being zoomed in. Similarly, some website don't interact well with the Firefox browser zoom, letting some information get lost. 

#### What happened when you tried it?

I was very disoriented while using the screen magnification app, just as John had mentioned. It is hard to not know the broader context of the webpage, and I kept getting lost while navigating. It was as if I had tunnel vision and kept forgetting what content had come before or will come afterward (defeating the point of being able to focus on one section at a time for myself).  

It is extremely useful to have the entire webpage in my peripheral while I was using the Windows and MacOS version of the magnifier, and I missed having that while doing my own testing with the website. While testing with the website, I also noticed how choppy the content can be. A large part of the screen was used just for the navbar, instead of it hiding away after sufficiently scrolling (this took up valuable screen real estate that could be used for more text/images). There was also a lot of horizontal scrolling because of the images and the text taking up more space that the width of the viewport. 

Overall, I saw how the experience with the zoom tool isn't just dependent on the magnifier, but also the way that the website handles different zoom levels. 

### Screen Reader

#### What is it?

According to [this website by the American Foundation for the Blind about Screen Readers](https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers), screen readers are (broadly) a form of Access Technology that converts on-screen content (including text, image, video) into speech or a braille display. Users send different keys combinations (commands) in order to instruct the Screen Reader to read out different sections or do different actions. They range in price and are avaiable on all forms of computers and phones.

#### What disabilities does it support?

The website also demonstrates how blind people are the ones who benefit from screen readers. Note that this also shows how Blind/VI AND deaf people can access computers (through the use of braille screens). This makes information that would be otherwise not have access to the wealth of knowledge found through technology. It also provides a way to interact with a computer for them to express themselves in writing, or to respond to emails they've recieved from colleagues. 

However, since there is no reading, it can be useful for those with ADHD and Dyslexia, as described in this [article by Accessibility Checker](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/blog/assistive-technology-for-dyslexia/). It reduces the fatigue that they faces from reading text with their eyes, and instead allows them to engage with their ears (which engages a different part of their brain). This helps increase the internalization of the information and take in the information in a way that is more conducive for them.

In addition, because of the minimized inputs that are required to use a screen reader, they can assist those with physical disabilities, including arthritis, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis. Even with limited mobility (including the inability to use a keyboard or mouse), they can still go through a webpage, recieve all the information present on the page, and then finally submit all of it to the users.


#### What are its strengths and/or weaknesses?

According to [Joey G. on his personal blog](https://www.blindstreet.com/advantages-disadvantages-using-screen-reader-instead-braille/#google_vignette), screen readers allow folks to access computers and functionality that they otherwise would not be able to (reading/writing emails, browsing the internet, communicate with instant messagers). This gives disabled folk the ability to be independent in doing tasks like looking at their email, browsing the web, or checking out the GSBA website (like we are simulating through our tests). 

The customizable settings also ensure that the technology can adjust to the individual's needs, whether they prefer a very fast speakers so they can consume information as a quick rate, or to go much slower.

Joey notes, however, that it can be hard to know the "correct spelling of a certain word especially when itâ€™s not that common like medical terms," and the artifical voices can be jarring and hard to use. Thus, this can make it hard for those with intellectual/learning disabilities to get the most out of it, as the artificial voices can detract and distract from the essense found within what the voices are talking about. There are platforms developing more realistic voices, but they are often paid services or in early access. 

#### What happened when you tried it?

The learning curve for a screen reader is STEEP, and I still input the wrong thing while using it. I also struggle with remembering the inputs. At the same, time, it is far slower for me to use than a pointer since that it what I've grown up using. With more practice, I have been able to really feel more in control. The shortcuts are very clear and not difficult to get used to, however they do use a lot of key presses which could make it difficult given a mobility-related disability. 

I noticed how important it is to have very clear navigation within a website. I noticed that if the z-order on the sections was inconsistent or confusing, I would struggle wisth actually go to the right thing in the webpage. For example, the navbar would be to the right of the homepage button in the logo, but I'd go to the navbar first and then the homepage button. This was confusing and made it frustrating to even use the technology. I also liked how while some users may not use the visual aspect, there still is a high contrast bounding box around the selected parts of the screen/content, which I find useful as a sighted person who uses a screen reader for a cognitive disability. 
 
## Summary of Problems

The problems were found in the percievability of text, the opperability of headers, and the understandability of how to navigate around to different tabs. The text was on an image background, which lead to issues of contrast at points, especially at the bottom of the webpage where the background image had more bright colors. There was also a weird error for the headers and the screen reader where the screen reader would view a single header as two objects because of some bolding. Most importantly and prominently, there was moving text on the screen in the form of a marquee and a custom slide in from left. Overall, the website was distracting and these all detracted from the content presented in the website.

## Summary of Solutions

The largest fix was in the website header. I made sure that the links inside of the header had letter-wrapping and were inside a flexbox, and thus no matter how zoomed in nor how wide the screen was, the text in its entirety would be readable and on screen. Similarly, I made sure the heading skip was removed, and instead I utilized an `<hgroup>` to pair the text with the header. I also switched the background to a flat color that is dark enough to contrast the foreground. To solve the issue of the split headers, I just used 1 color (which coincidentally helped improve the percievability of the header and removed the use of color for meaning).
  
## Conclusion (What Did I Learn?)

Above all, I practiced using accessibility technology to a further extent, now able to use a screen reader to comfortably navigate around a computer (even without a screen). I also learned how to brainstorm fixes to these issues. I have very minimal experience with user-facing systems (most of my prior programming experience is with systems programming and back-end broadly). It was nice to return to some HTML and CSS. I also noticed how there were gaps in the learning we had in CIC and I'm glad to pick up new skills to actually apply the principles I'm learning in this Accessibility class! Now, I feel like I can sense where a website has issues, and then really pinpoint the problem to a certain solution.
