### Switch Control

#### What is it?

According to [Apple's website about Switch Control on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-switch-control-mh43607/mac), switch control is a technology that allows a single button or joystick to be used and control the entirety of a Mac [1]. It is also avaiable on iPhone, according to [Apple's website about Switch Control on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/intro-to-switch-control-iphc9d32b862/ios).

## Automated Accessibility Checking Competency

### What automated tool did you use?

The automated tool I used was [WAVE by WebAIM](https://wave.webaim.org/). This is a "suite of evaluation tools that helps authors make their web content more accessible to individuals with disabilities," allowing developers to address potential WCAG violations in their page, which also learning about accessible design. 

### What did you like most and dislike most about it?

My favorite part of this tool was how neat and easy-to-read the summary was. The UI added to the experience, letting me know *exactly* where the errors were (as well as categories to see what areas of accessibility needed more attention). When clicking on an error, it would direct you to the location in the website, as well as. Contrast being its own section was a good choice, as it also allows for easy analysis of what could potentially be a better color choice. 

I dislike how the sidebar cannot hide. Sometimes I wanted to have more real-estate to view the code. It would have been nice to have a tab to the left where I could pull up DOM . 

### How did you use it to check POUR?

Thankfully, WAVE checks for WCAG compliance, and WCAG is based on the principles of POUR. The different errors cite which standards and guidelines of WCAG may be violated. While this is automatic, I also made sure that the citations were correct, and interpretted the output for myself, ensuring the given error matches the actual output in the browser.
    
## Accessibility Rules Competency

### Which website and tasks within that website were you assessing?

I accessed the GSBA (Greater Seattle Business Association). The tasks to be analyzed were:

1. Donate money to the GSBA (including becoming a member, providing a scholarship)
2. RSVP/get details for events advertised on the GSBA website
3. Learn about how to get my buisness LGBTBE certified/how to do accessibility training
