By Violet Monserate

## Reflection prompts

### Tasks you were testing in your submission

1. Donate money to the GSBA (including becoming a member, providing a scholarship)
2. RSVP/get details for events advertised on the GSBA website
3. Learn about how to get my buisness LGBTBE certified/how to do accessibility training

### Problems you could only identify with manual testing using an accessibility technology?

One of the issues I only caught while doing manual testing were when images had null/empty alt text. These are flagged as "positive" by the automatic technology, and only when I went through it and had it read the image aloud to me did I realize that I could not understand where it was taking me.

## Accessibility Technology Familiarity Competency

### Magnifier

#### What is it?

The magnifier is an access technology that has found its way into many piece of technology, including Windows 11 and 10 (according to this [Webpage on Microsoft's Support Page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-magnifier-to-make-things-on-the-screen-easier-to-see-414948ba-8b1c-d3bd-8615-0e5e32204198)), as well as the 

#### What disabilities does it support?

The manifier supports those with Visual Impairment, such as John Klatt [in this Youtube video from the University of Wisconsin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZRVDgeMpXc). John Klatt has a form of muscular degeneration, and shows how different types of magnification work better/are less disorienting than others. 

#### What are its strengths and/or weaknesses?

There is a wide variety of magnification softwares, including the ones demonstrated in the aforementioned Youtube video. This means that 

#### What happened when you tried it?

I was very disoriented while using the screen magnification. It is hard to not know the broader context of the webpage, and I kept getting lost while navigating. It is extremely useful to have the entire webpage in my peripheral, and I missed having that while doing my own testing.

### Screen Reader

#### What is it?

According to [this website by the American Foundation for the Blind about Screen Readers](https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers), screen readers are (broadly) a form of Access Technology that converts on-screen content (including text, image, video) into speech or a braille display. Users send different keys combinations (commands) in order to instruct the Screen Reader to read out different sections or do different actions. They range in price and are avaiable on all forms of computers and phones.

#### What disabilities does it support?

The website also demonstrates how 

#### What are its strengths and/or weaknesses?

According to [Joey G. on his personal blog](https://www.blindstreet.com/advantages-disadvantages-using-screen-reader-instead-braille/#google_vignette), screen readers 

#### What happened when you tried it?
         
## Automated Accessibility Checking Competency

### What automated tool did you use?

The automated tool I used was [WAVE by WebAIM](https://wave.webaim.org/). This is a "suite of evaluation tools that helps authors make their web content more accessible to individuals with disabilities," allowing developers to address potential WCAG violations in their page, which also learning about accessible design. 

### What did you like most and dislike most about it?

My favorite part of this tool was how neat and easy-to-read the summary was. The UI added to the experience, letting me know *exactly* where the errors were (as well as categories to see what areas of accessibility needed more attention). When clicking on an error, it would direct you to the location in the website, as well as. Contrast being its own section was a good choice, as it also allows for easy analysis of what could potentially be a better color choice. 

I dislike how the sidebar cannot hide. Sometimes I wanted to have more real-estate to view the code. It would have been nice to have a tab to the left where I could pull up DOM . 

### How did you use it to check POUR?

Thankfully, WAVE checks for WCAG compliance, and WCAG is based on the principles of POUR. The different errors cite which standards and guidelines of WCAG may be violated. While this is automatic, I also made sure that the citations were correct, and interpretted the output for myself, ensuring the given error matches the actual output in the browser.
    
## Accessibility Rules Competency

### Which website and tasks within that website were you assessing?

I accessed the GSBA (Greater Seattle Business Association). The tasks to be analyzed were:

1. Donate money to the GSBA (including becoming a member, providing a scholarship)
2. RSVP/get details for events advertised on the GSBA website
3. Learn about how to get my buisness LGBTBE certified/how to do accessibility training
