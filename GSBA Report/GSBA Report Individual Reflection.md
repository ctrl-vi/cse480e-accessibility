# GSBA Report Individual Reflection

Created by: Violet Monserate

## What was your role in writing the report? How, if at all, did you contribute to making the report accessible?

I made sure to use headings that were accessible, and that we were all following the different header levels and a general organizational pattern to make the paper easier to navigate. Similarly, I made sure that the style being utilized throughout the report was consistent (especially with the headers). In addition, I made sure that images had alt text (and also improved the alt text I had gotten comments on in the previous assignment).

## How did your contributions compare to those of your group members?

I think we all contribute in a substantial way for each of the sections we divied out. During times when were working at the same time, we collaborated and all added in additions/changes according to the different parts of the work that we brought. For example, for the final section (before the appendix) I took up writing 1/3 of the UARs summary, just as my group members had done. We all brought a sufficient number of UARs and added them into the assignment. Overall, we all contributed in a meaninful way to the final product.

## When writing the report, did you read and follow class guidelines on GAI use?

I did not employ any GAI while writing the parts of the report that I had worked on. 

## Would you like to be assessed or re-assessed on any competencies?

I do not want to be assessed on any additional competencies.
