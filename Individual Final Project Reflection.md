# Individual Final Project Reflection 

Written by Violet Monserate

# What was your overall role in the final project? 

I helped make the home page for the website. I also helped make the slides for the checkpoints and the final poster and report. This included refining the language that was used in each of . My primary contribution on the report was plain language, disability justice, and positive dsiability sections. 

# How do you feel about your contributions to the project?

I feel really good about my contributions! I really feel like my additions and changes were respected, even if other people decided to edit them again and build off of them. I also felt like my group members carried their weight and were equally supporting in the creation of everything. 

# For Accessible Document Creation, besides this document, what did you make accessible?

I helped make the slides to be accessible during our checkpoints. This included making sure the slides didn't have too much information. For the website, I made sure that the theme was not too busy, and that the For the poster, I made sure that the z-order made sense. 

# For Image Description, include any images you wrote alt text for in this report with their alt text

I personally did not do any image description for the final report. 

# For Plain Language Writing, did you help with the plain language? If so, which plain language writing principals should we use to assess your plain language summary? You donâ€™t need to include the summary itself here, we will look at that on your project web page.

I did help with the plain language. The main plain language principles you should take into account are short sentences, limited vocab, transition words, and present tense.

# Did you help with the disability justice analysis? If so, how?

I helped make sure the writing read better. This involved editing the connections of the evidence to the principles themselves. I especially helped make the connection to anti-capitalist politics stronger and clearer. I also made sure we used examples in the analysis that made sense.

# Did you help with the Positive Disability Principals analysis? If so, how?

I also helped tighten up the writing for this section. The links between the principles and what was sometimes shakey and it was unclear what polistive disability principal was talked about. I make sure that that was clear to our audience. We also wrote a bit too much in the section, so I helped trim it down, while making sure the examples we provided were sharp. 

# When writing the report, did you read and follow class guidelines on GAI use?

I did not use GAI while creating the report or any other aspect of the final project. My group and I wrote everything by ourselves, without need for GAI.
